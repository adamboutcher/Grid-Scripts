# Grid Scripts


## About

This reposistory is full of scripts I have written while maintaining a Cluster for [GridPP](https://www.gridpp.ac.uk/) when I was working at the [IPPP](https://www.ippp.dur.ac.uk) at [Durham University](https://www.dur.ac.uk).

All code contained is Copyright myself (Adam Boutcher) and/or the IPPP unless otherwise stated in the header of the file. They are provided free for use but include no liability or warrenty; more or less the GPLv3.

More from me at my [website](http://www.aboutcher.co.uk).
